# GFStaticMap

GFStaticMap is a static map API similar to Google Static Maps which stitches map
tiles together and adds markers on top if requested. It is based on a older version
of StaticMapLite by Harald Koch but was extended by following features:

* render lines and simple areas on top of the base map
* place markers (StaticMapLite also got this feature but has a different syntax)
* custom marker labels (one character)
